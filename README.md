## Word Sprint for Obsidian
Repo which will hold the Word Sprint for Obsidian plugin.

### Features
- TBD

### Installation
The Word Sprint for Obsidian plugin release is pending being written, so it's not even anywhere yet.

### Manual Installation
Two methods and the first one is easier:

#### Method 1
- Enable community plugins and install Obsidian42 - BRAT
- Go to settings and under Beta Plugin List click "Add Beta plugin" and type kinabalu/obsidian-word-sprint

#### Method 2
- Create an `obsidian-word-sprint` folder under `.obsidian/plugins` in your vault. Add the
`main.js`, `manifest.json`, and the `styles.css` files from the
[latest release](https://github.com/kinabalu/obsidian-word-sprint/releases) to the folder.
