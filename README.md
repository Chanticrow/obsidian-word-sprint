## Word Sprint for Obsidian
Word Sprint for Obsidian is a plugin which helps an obsidian user who does any writing tasks
with achieving that flow state that we are looking for. It offers you the ability to create
sprints of time (by default 25 minutes) and times and gives you guidance along the way to
keep you writing and not checking Twitter.

The plugin was inspired by discussion on Discord in the NANOWRIMO 2021 thread of creative.
